# Command Loader

In this guide, we will explain how to get started with command handlers, create multiple commands in one file, and handle events.

## Why Should You Use a Loader?

Why should you use a command handler? Storing your commands in a single file may seem fine at first, but as the number of commands grows, it becomes difficult to find and update them. That's why you should use a command handler to maintain order in your main file and rid yourself of clutter.

## Main File

In the `LoadCommands` class constructor, it is mandatory to specify your instance of the `AoiClient` class. In the `loadCommands` method, the first argument is the path to the folder, and the second argument is responsible for console output.

```javascript
const { LoadCommands } = require("aoitelegram");

const loader = new LoadCommands(bot).loadCommands("./command/", true);
```

## Example

### One Command in a File

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="esm" label="ESModule">
```javascript
export default {
  name: "ping",
  code: `$replyMessage[Bot ping: $ping ms]`,
};
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="commonjs" label="Commonjs">
```javascript
module.exports = {
  name: "ping",
  code: `$replyMessage[Bot ping: $ping ms]`,
};
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Multiple Commands in a File

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="esm" label="ESModule">
```javascript
export default [
  {
    name: "ping",
    code: `$replyMessage[Bot ping: $ping ms]`,
  },
  {
    name: "pong",
    code: `$replyMessage[ping 🏓]`,
  },
];
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="commonjs" label="Commonjs">
```javascript
module.exports = [
  {
    name: "ping",
    code: `$replyMessage[Bot ping: $ping ms]`,
  },
  {
    name: "pong",
    code: `$replyMessage[ping 🏓]`,
  },
];
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Events

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="esm" label="ESModule">
```javascript
export default [
  {
    name: "count",
    code: `$replyMessage[Count value: $getVar[count]]`,
  },
  {
    type: "message",
    code: `$setVar[count;$message[1]]`,
  },
];
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="commonjs" label="Commonjs">
```javascript
module.exports = [
  {
    name: "count",
    code: `$replyMessage[Count value: $getVar[count]]`,
  },
  {
    type: "message",
    code: `$setVar[count;$message[1]]`,
  },
];
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
